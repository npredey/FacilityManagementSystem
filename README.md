# FacilityManagementSystem
In this project, we will start providing an object domain model for Facility Management System by
addressing the design and implementation using OOP. The aim is to have a domain model that is
designed using OOP that will be used to study Object relationship and Dependency. 

Based on the specification provided for a Facility Management System:

    – Identify the main entitles of the problem domain.
    – Identify their attributes.
    – Identify their relationships.
    – Identify their roles and responsibilities.
    – Discover other objects that facilitate implementing responsibilities.
    – Make available all client interfaces/services specified in the specification document
    (Facility, Facility Use, and Facility Maintenance Client Interfaces). 

In part two of the project, we changed the object dependency and collaboration management from directly
instantiating to Dependency Injection container (Spring). This is located in the app_context.xml file.
